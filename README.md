# Lab-Covid19-jadams18
In this lab, you are going to visually depict the outbreak of COVID-19 in this country. To do this you will need to follow these steps
1. Using the geographical data from the US Census (provided to you) load the FIPS ID, population, and longitude/latitude of each county in America.
2. Draw each county in America
3. Cross reference the data you loaded above with the New York Times COVID-19 data stored on GitHub
4. Place GUI controls in your frame that allow you to control the current date you are viewing; whether the COVID-19 date is relative or absolute; and whether you are displaying the number of cases or the number of fatalities.
5. Given the current mix of GUI controls you chose above, display a circle centered at each county that displays the appropriate data scaled as you see fit.
6. You do not need to color each state but you can if you like the way it looks
